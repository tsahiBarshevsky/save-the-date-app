# _Save The Date - a mdicines management native app_

### About this project 

I'm using some ointments because of my allergy, and all of them need to be thrown away after a certain amount of time since opening. The problem is I can't always remember when I've opened an ointment, and sometimes I throw it away for no reason because of it. So, in order to avoid it, I've built this native app.
Save The Date is a native app that allows you to manage a list of medicine or cosmetics that you're using. Once you add a new medicine, the system will calculate the date you should throw it away, based on the opening date and usage time.

Main features: Quick authentication using Firebase, setting image for your account and display how much time is left until the end date. The app also contains a calendar screen that allows you to explore which medicine opened or ended on a certain day.
Save The Date is a MERN Stack app: For the server side I've been using Express.JS, MongoDB as a database and Firebase for authentication and storage .For the client side I've been using React Native (Expo) with Redux as a state management.
